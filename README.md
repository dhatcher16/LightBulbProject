# Lightbulbs Problem
There are N bulbs, numbered from 1 to N, arranged in a row. The first bulb is plugged
into the power socket and each successive bulb is connected to the previous one (the
second bulb to the first, the third bulb to the second, etc.).
Initially, all the bulbs are turned off. At moment K (for K from 0 to Nâˆ’1), we turn on the
A[K]-th bulb. A bulb shines if it is on and all the previous bulbs are turned on too.
Write a function solution that, given an array A of N different integers from 1 to N,
returns the number of moments for which every turned on bulb shines.
